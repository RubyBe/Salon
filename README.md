## Description/Specs

A program which builds a web app which accepts both a single word and then a string of multiple words. The Web app is then able to return a count of full-word matches of the single word within the string of multiple words.

* Web design is two pages: a first page with a form allowing the player to enter the search word and the string of words; and a second page which displays the search and count results.
